    Set the wrapper (span) to inline-block to retain inline functionality and also have block level properties.
    Set width to the full width of the parent.
    Change the transform origin, meaning the point from where a transformation starts. Originally is (0, 0), which at a
    box would be the upper left corner. We set it to 50% 50% (x-axis, y-axis) to place it on the center of the box in
    2 dimensional space. The third value sets the origin of the z-axis, essentially dictating how close or far away the
    user will interpret the box moving from him. By setting a small negative value proportional to the size of the text
    we make it appear so that the movement happens backwards and slightly in place. The larger the value, the closer to
    the user to box appears, the smaller, the further away.
    transform-style: preserve-3d makes the children of the 3D element preserve their stacking context in the 3D space
    and not flatten down to 2 dimensional space.
    The transition dictates how the transformation will occur, and the cubic bezier function dictates how the object will
    transform in time using the bezier parametric function.

    the link element wouldn't be colored.
    Backface visibility dictates whether the hidden sides of the 3D box are showing. Since the perspective is small,
    there is rotation and the backgrounds aren't transparent there isn't any visible change but for maintenance
    reasons we decided to keep it because if we change the opacity level a small line appears below the button.
