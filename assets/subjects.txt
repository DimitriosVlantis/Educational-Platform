	COMBINATORICS - Combinatorics is a branch of pure mathematics concerning the study of discrete (and usually finite) objects. It is related to many other areas of mathematics, such as algebra, probability theory, ergodic theory and geometry, as well as to applied subjects in computer science and statistical physics.
		PROBABILITY THEORY - Randomness is all around us. Probability theory is the mathematical framework that allows us to analyze chance events in a logically sound manner. The probability of an event is a number indicating how likely that event will occur. This number is always between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty.
		STATISTICS - Statisticians and mathematicians examine data and apply business models as they study and solve organizational challenges. After determining which data they need to resolve a problem, they use surveys and experiments to gather information. Study statistics today to be able to effectively conduct research, to be able to read and evaluate journal articles, and to further develop critical thinking and analytic skills.
		DISCRETE MATHEMATICS - Discrete Mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with separable and distinct numbers. Combinations, graph theory, and logical statements are included, and numbers can be finite or infinite. It's used in computer science to design the apps and programs we use every day. While there are no hard and fast definitions of discrete mathematics, it's well known for the things it excludes - continuously varying quantities and all things related to that. Discrete mathematics is vital to digital devices. With tech continually on the rise, studying this overlooked area of mathematics could prove valuable for your career and your future.
CHEMISTRY - Chemistry is the science and study of matter, including its properties, composition as well as reactivity. Chemistry relates to everything that can be sensed from the minute elements to complex structures. The atom and molecules are the basic unit or components of Chemistry.

The program prepares the student to work in crime laboratories or other law enforcement agencies, such as FDA, OSHA, and EPA, or for graduate work in forensic chemistry, forensic science or analytical chemistry.
		ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY - Analytical chemistry is the science of obtaining, processing, and communicating information about the composition and structure of matter. In other words, it is the art and science of determining what matter is and how much of it exists.
	BIO CHEMISTRY - Biochemistry is the application of chemistry to the study of biological processes at the cellular and molecular level. It emerged as a distinct discipline around the beginning of the 20th century when scientists combined chemistry, physiology, and biology to investigate the chemistry of living systems.
		MICROBIOLOGY - Microbiology is a branch of study that deals with microorganisms that cannot be seen without the aid of the microscope. This study enables us to understand the growth and reproduction rate of microorganisms. It also assists in the detection of pathological diseases.
		ENZYMOLOGY - In computational enzymology, the comprehension of an enzyme reaction mechanism and evaluation of the corresponding reaction and activation free energy barriers (and reaction rates through TST) require a thorough characterization of the free energy landscape, stable basins, and the concomitant reaction paths.
		GENETICS - Genetics and genomics both play roles in health and disease. Genetics refers to the study of genes and the way that certain traits or conditions are passed down from one generation to another. Genomics describes the study of all of a person's genes (the genome).
