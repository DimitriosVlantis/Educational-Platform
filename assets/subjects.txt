COMPUTER SCIENCE - The most important aspect of computer science is problem-solving, an essential skill for life.
Students study the design, development and analysis of software and hardware used to solve problems in a variety of
business, scientific and social contexts. Explore computer science paths and courses today.

	PROGRAMMING - Learn all about how to become an expert computer programmer and write and test code that allows
	computer applications and software programs to function properly using different programming languages and
	programming paradigms.

		OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING WITH JAVA - Discover object-oriented programming through the Java programming
		language and learn how to properly design applications using polymorphism, encapsulation, inheritance,
		composition and UML.
		FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING WITH PYTHON - Discover functional programming through the Python programming language and
		 learn how to design applications using immutability, disciplined state, referential transparency, pure
		 functions and no side effects, and first class functions and high order functions.
		REACTIVE (ASYNCHRONOUS) PROGRAMMING WITH C++ - Discover reactive programming through the C++ programming
		language and learn how to properly design event-driven and asynchronous applications using uncertainty,
		responsiveness, autonomy, consistency, dynamic handling, and time and space decoupling.
	FRONT END - Learn all about how to become a front-end developer using cutting edge technology features and best
	practices and turn professional designs into professional interactive web pages.
		HTML - Discover how to write semantic HTML and enrich text content with the appropriate tags and attributes to
		transform it to a professional web document ready for the world-wide web and the popular search engines.
		CSS - Discover how to use Cascading Style Sheets to transform HTML documents to live and beautiful designs.
		JAVASCRIPT - Discover how to use the most popular programming language, JavaScript, to solve difficult
		programming problems, develop applications, transform web pages to web applications and consume information from
		 APIs.
	BACK END - Learn all about back-end development and how to develop applications and APIs that communicate with
	distributed components like databases and different front-ends and use this knowledge to become an expert
	problem-solver.
		NODE.JS - Discover how to use node. js to bring event-driven programming to web servers, enabling development
		of fast web servers in JavaScript. Create scalable servers without using threading, by using a simplified model
		of event-driven programming that uses callbacks to signal the completion of a task.
		MONGO DB - Discover how to use mongoDB, which is an open source NoSQL database management program. NoSQL is
		used as an
		alternative to
		traditional relational databases. NoSQL databases are quite useful for working with large sets of distributed data. MongoDB is a tool that can manage document-oriented information, store or retrieve information.
		DEV OPS - Learn the basic DevOps (a portmanteau of “development” and “operations”) principles to improve
		collaboration between operations and development teams. Learn the practices and tools enabling automation,
		defining practices, and implementing CI/CD pipelines to speed up your development and team collaboration.
